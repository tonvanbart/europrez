Description: "EP29 hotel and sign up"

The hotel for EP29 will be the [Hotel Held](https://www.hotel-held.de/), close to Regensburg.
We roughly figured out two routes: a) aound the Arber-hill and the lake Arbersee and b) to the Altmühltal. For the non-bike tours we are preparing more than enough sight-seeings (Old city of Regensburg, Donaudurchbruch and Schloss Weltenburg by boat, Walhalla and more).

_**Cost:**_ 
{{< line_break >}}
The price per person will be 79€ per night plus 22,80 for dinner(mandatory). Dinner will be a buffet and one day a barbecue.
Parking, Sauna and Spa are included.

Single room will be 18€ extra

_**Payment:**_
There is no early deposit. The full price will have to be paid later 14 days before arrival (meaning June 12th, 2025) to the account of the hotel.

_**Sign up:**_
If you're interested in coming, please fill out the final [sign up form]({{< ref "/signup" >}}) so our dictator 
can keep track of the number of rooms needed and the number of people to expect for the food.

The deadline for the transfer of names to the hotel is April 30, so be sure to fill out the form before then! ("Be there or be square"). Thanks in advance!
