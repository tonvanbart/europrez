### The Smelly Socks Tour
Every year since 1996, members of the Europrez email list have had an in-person "EP" meeting.
Meetings are organized by a volunteer (sort of...) list member who will normally find a 
hotel and plan some routes in a nice area in their home country. 

Past events took place in Antwerp (EP1, 1996), Neuenburg (EP2, 1997, Germany), Moena (EP3, 1998, Italy), Hindas (EP4, 1999, Sweden), Lynmouth (EP5, 2000, UK), Lisbon (EP6, 2001, Portugal), Torwang (EP7, 2002, Bavaria).  
There is a [trip report](http://www.steliosh.net/ep8/) of the EP8 event in 2003 in Rouze Gazon, France, and another [trip report](http://www.steliosh.net/ep9/ep9photos/index.html) of a trip to EP9 in Zwartsluis, the Netherlands in 2004. 
    
The EP10 meetup went back to the roots in Belgium and was held in the Ardennes in 2005; there is another report of the [trip to EP11](http://www.steliosh.net/epxi) in Flueli Ranft (Switzerland, 2006).  
EP12 was in the Dolomites (Italy, 2007); there is a [web album](http://www.mijnalbum.nl/Album=NQ4I7QWR). Meetups continued in the Harz (EP13, Germany, 2008), the Jura (EP14, France, 2009); Denetice (EP15, Czech Republic, 2010), Tyleb√§ck (EP16, near Halmstad, Sweden, 2011); Wittlich (EP17, Germany, 2012 - there is an [album on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armand-marechal/sets/72157630385552988/), opens on a new page).  

EP18 took place in Friuli (Italy, 2013); EP19 in Ryn (Poland, 2014); EP20 went back to the EP10 site in Buellingen (Ardennes, 2015).  
The Smelly Socks Tour continued to Hay-on-Wye (EP21, 2016, UK); Heiligenstadt (EP22, 2017, Germany); Cuneo (EP23, 2018, Italy); Boppard (EP24, 2019, Germany) and - slimmed down due to the COVID pandemic - Moena (EP25, 2020, Italy).

Sadly, again due to the pandemic there was no EP at all in 2021; in 2022 EP26 was held in Hallenberg, Germany. The 2023 EP27 edition was in Rhenen, the Netherlands.
